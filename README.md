# Algorithms written at an intermediate
All coded in Python3 with Notepad++ <br/>
Assumes correct syntax <br/> <br />
## Addition Multiplication Evaluation.py
Evaluates expressions with only '*' and '+' such that the program obtains the largest possible result. <br />
Uses Dynamic Programming <br /><br />
## GCD (without import).py
Calculates the GCD Greatest Common Denominator (without gcd library import) <br /><br />
## GCD.py
Calculates the GCD Greatest Common Denominator (with gcd library import) <br /><br />
## Heapsort subset.py
Heapsort. Output sorted subset of integers <br /><br />
## Insertion Sort, moves, addInversions.py
Insertion Sort, outputs sorted list, additional inversions <br /><br />
## Longest DAG Path from Vertex 0.py
Finds the length of the longest path starting from vertex 0 in a DAG <br /><br />
## Maximum Conjestion NetworkX.py
Returns maximum congestion level of a graph from some vertex u,v. <br />
Congestion is defined as number of edge-disjoint paths meaning  <br />
no usage of edges as other paths, however nodes may be reused. <br /><br />
## Mergesort on two columns.py
Sort two columns of integers with Mergesort <br /><br />
## OTP XOR Cracker.py
Using automated analysis and guess work to decrypt encrypted message. <br /><br />
## Retrieve value from Infinite Juxtaposing sequence.py
Return value at an index of an infinite sequence created by <br />
juxtaposing the increasing larger sequences of incremented integers <br />
e.g. 11212312341234512345612345671234567812345678912345678910 <br />
Uses Divide-and-Conquer programming approach. <br />
